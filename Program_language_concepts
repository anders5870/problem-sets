Persistent data type 
--------------------

A data type that never changes. When a data type is being modified,
 a copy is made instead of changing the current data type. 
It will result in multiple copies instead of changing the current data type.

Immutable - An object that cannot be changed.
Ephemeral - opposite of persistent.
Partially persistent - only the most recent copy can be modified but all can be accessed
Fully persistent - all copies can be modified and accessed

Concurrency models
------------------
Software transactional memory(STM) - Is a concurrency control mechanism that solves the same 
problem that lock-based synchronization solves. It is an alteranative.
Futures -
Actor model - 
Coroutines -



Random concepts
---------------

Subroutines - 
First-class function - functions are values.
First-class citizen - type, object, entity, or value that is generally used in many aspects
 of the language. It is a basic building block.
BEAM - erlang virtual machine
Rust - made by Mozilla for web browsers. Is BLAZINGLY fast. Memory safety is one of the main
 goals.
Lazy evaluation -
Currying - 
Type inference -
Type reconstruction -
